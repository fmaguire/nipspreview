NIPS Preview
============

An update of [Karpathy's](https://github.com/karpathy/nipspreview) LDA based
NIP preview site generation scripts.
The idea is to clean up the code and convert to python3.

Currently a work in progress but ideally:

    ./main.py $directory $NIPShtml

Will generate a full page in that `$directory`
